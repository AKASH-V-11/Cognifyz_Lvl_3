📊 Cognifyz Data Analysis Internship – Level 3 Tasks
-------
Welcome to the repository for Level 3 of the Cognifyz Technologies Data Analysis Internship. This advanced level focuses on deeper insights using Natural Language Processing (NLP), correlation analysis, and categorical comparisons from restaurant datasets.


🧪 Task Overview
---
🔍 Task 1: Restaurant Reviews Analysis
------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
-
Analyze customer reviews to extract the most common positive and negative keywords.

>What I did:
Cleaned and tokenized textual reviews.
Identified frequent keywords associated with positive and negative sentiments.
Calculated the average review length.
Explored the relationship between review length and restaurant ratings using visualization.
Insights:
Positive reviews tend to include words like “delicious”, “friendly”, “amazing”.
Negative reviews highlight terms like “late”, “rude”, “cold food”.
Longer reviews are often tied to stronger opinions — both high and low ratings.

📈 Task 2: Votes Analysis
-
Objective:
-
Analyze the number of votes received by restaurants and explore correlation with their ratings.
>What I did:
Identified restaurants with highest and lowest votes.
Calculated the correlation coefficient between number of votes and aggregate ratings.
Insights:
Strongly voted restaurants typically have moderate to high ratings, indicating a link between popularity and quality.
Correlation value suggested a moderate positive relationship between votes and ratings.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧾 Task 3: Price Range vs. Online Delivery & Table Booking
-
Objective:
-
Determine if restaurants with higher price ranges are more likely to offer online delivery or table booking.
>What I did:
Cross-tabulated price range with online delivery and table booking availability.
Visualized the relationship using grouped bar plots.
Insights:
Higher-priced restaurants are more likely to offer table bookings.
Online delivery is popular across all price ranges, but especially high in mid-range restaurants.
